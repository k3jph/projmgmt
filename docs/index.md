# Welcome

Welcome to _Project Management and Public Administration_.  This interactive document is an evolving work that is being created for MSA 647 People and Project Administration at [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu/global/courses/pages/default.aspx?course=MSA647).  The course is part of CMU's master of science in administration program which provides a semester-long course in the communications and people management associated with project management.  

This document set aims to expand the course material to cover project management in the context of public administration.  The goal is to collect high-quality material from around the Internet, especially video content, and create a single story for students to work with.
