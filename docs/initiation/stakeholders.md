## Understanding the Stakeholders' Places

Stakeholders are a challenge for project managers.  The biggest
part of that challenge is understanding who counts as a stakeholder
and _why they matter_.  We also have to remember that not all
stakeholders carry the same value.  For instance, in a major
government project, members of Congress may get involved.  A Senator
or Representative can be a very powerful ally for a project.  But
they also carry only as much interest as they can politically afford.
On the other hand, if a project benefits a group without political
power, such as prisoners, they may be an ally, but they carry no
power.  But they very interested in the project.

These are two extreme examples, but getting understanding the role
of stakeholders is critical for effective project management.  It
is best to keep all stakeholders happy, but often different
stakeholders have conflicting desires.  This is when decisions have
to be made.  Balancing stakeholder interests is probably the most
difficult of job of a project manager

???+ tip
    Not all stakeholders can be satisfied and the project sponsor
    can work with you to provide a decision model for making these
    choices.
